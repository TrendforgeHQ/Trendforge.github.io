# BOAT Changelog

All entries should describe actual work and results. Do not record planned work as completed.

## 2026-10-11 — Initial blueprint / Phase 0
- Inspected repository metadata and confirmed `main` is the default branch.
- Inspected `app/control-center/page.tsx`, `scripts/trendforge-supervisor.mjs`, `scripts/trendforge-self-learning.mjs`, and `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.
- Confirmed Control Center is static-export based; Supervisor is advisory-observational; Self-Learning is shadow/aggregate-oriented; publishing schedule is every six hours with manual dispatch and no current topic input.
- Added the BOAT blueprint, README, roadmap, canonical project state, decision log, permissions policy, learning register, baseline audit, and next-step file; updated root `PROJECT.md`.
- Created branch: `docs/boat-blueprint-phase0-2026-10-11`.
- Opened draft PR #35: https://github.com/TrendforgeHQ/Trendforgehq.github.io/pull/35
- Initial commit: `0a0dde3ea372013f605d12effaadbc0abdb77d31` (documentation changes; PR branch may receive a follow-up record commit).
- No paid provider was called. No article, publishing workflow, provider routing, production behavior, or gate was changed.
- Validation at last check: repository files and PR contents are available on GitHub; the draft PR reports no check runs yet. Build/test result is therefore **unknown/pending**, not passed.
- Next action: complete the read-only interface map described in [NEXT_STEP.md](NEXT_STEP.md), after reviewing this blueprint.


## 2026-10-11 — Phase 0.2 artifact map
- Inspected the pre-writer pipeline, authoritative evidence pack, adaptive writer evidence gate, smart claim verifier, grounding repair, editorial intelligence, quality validator, and publishing workflow sequence.
- Indexed three archived failed claim-verification reports as AD-FX-001..003 (runs 38085367295, 37996683799, 37696062759); they have not been replayed.
- Added the Article Doctor report schema, archived-fixture index, and offline test plan.
- Expanded the baseline audit with artifact producer/consumer/provenance/gap notes.
- No production source, articles, workflows, providers, or gates changed. No paid calls, image generation, build, or publish run triggered.
- Evaluator tests and schema/path checks remain pending; no passing result is claimed.

- Follow-up validation: report schema and fixture index both parse as JSON; all nine indexed article/report/metadata paths exist on main. No evaluator replay or build was run.


## 2026-10-11 — Phase 1 offline Article Doctor implementation
- Added `scripts/boat-article-doctor.mjs` for read-only diagnostics from saved article, claim report, and optional metadata; report includes provenance hashes, integrity findings, and limitations.
- Added `scripts/test-boat-article-doctor.mjs` covering archived fixtures, deterministic output, unsupported/contradicted/numeric/attribution/scope signals, title/run mismatches, CLI error behavior, and input immutability. Test execution is **pending**; no pass is claimed.
- Added `.github/workflows/boat-offline-tests.yml` scoped to the BOAT branch and BOAT PR paths. This workflow only invokes Node's built-in test runner; it does not call providers or publishing.
- Inspected failure logs for [run 38062572123](https://github.com/TrendforgeHQ/Trendforgehq.github.io/actions/runs/38062572123): Step 14 failed because Run 405 calibration tried to download expired artifact `10713098432` and received HTTP 410. Earlier steps 1–13 passed; downstream steps were skipped.
- Inspected PR #34's follow-up run [38066111717](https://github.com/TrendforgeHQ/Trendforgehq.github.io/actions/runs/38066111717): the live claim-verifier regression suite passed, while the historical calibration was skipped due to HTTP 410. The overall green result did not establish that calibration passed.
- Found the archived Run 405 article and `article-brief.json` on `main`, but the archived `authoritative-evidence-pack.json` file is empty and the original artifact listing is empty. Updated PR #34's calibration script to reconstruct a durable, clearly labelled evidence pack from saved brief grounding passages and to retain the expected 11/2/2 assertion. This is a reconstruction, not an exact historical replay; result pending actual CI logs.
- No direct `main` edits, merges, paid provider calls, publishing runs, image generation, or production gate changes were made.
